This is a team project from a Database Management class. It contains a website for customers and a website for inventory.
Multiple mySQL databases were designed for a bike shop based on a list of criteria and assumptions.
There are established relationships between databases of inventory, vendors, employees, payments, etc.
There are queries that indentify specific information requested in the assumptions.
Login examples can be found within the customer database.
